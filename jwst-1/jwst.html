                        <p>
                            The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is the most powerful telescope ever built, 
                            and it is already revolutionizing our understanding of the universe. JWST sees the universe in infrared light, 
                            which allows it to see through dust and gas clouds that obscure objects from view in visible light. 
                            This gives JWST an unprecedented view of the early universe, star formation, and exoplanets.
                        </p>
            </div>
            <div class="div">
                <h3>Early universe</h3>
                <p>One of the most important discoveries of JWST has been the detection of galaxies that formed just a few hundred 
                    million years after the Big Bang. These galaxies are much more massive and evolved than previously thought, 
                    and they challenge our understanding of how galaxies form and evolve.</p>

                  title="a pair of merging galaxies" class="img">
                <a><p class="img_src">src: esawebb.org/images/potm2210a/</p></a>
                <p>JWST has also observed galaxies that are merging and colliding. These collisions can trigger bursts of star formation, 
                    and they can also create new galaxies. JWST is helping us to understand how galaxies evolve over time.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="div">
                <h3>Star formation</h3>
                <p>JWST is also providing new insights into star formation. JWST has observed protostars that are still forming within their natal gas clouds, 
                    and it has detected jets and outflows of material from young stars. These observations are helping us to understand how 
                    stars form and how they interact with their surroundings.</p>

                <p>JWST has also observed star-forming regions in other galaxies. These observations are helping us to understand 
                    how star formation varies across different galaxies.</p>

            <div class="div">
                <h3>Exoplanets</h3>
                <p>JWST is also well-suited for studying exoplanets. JWST can detect the faint infrared light emitted by exoplanets, 
                    and it can also analyze the atmospheres of exoplanets for signs of water, methane, and other molecules. 
                    JWST has already detected water vapor in the atmosphere of an exoplanet, and it is expected to make many more discoveries 
                    in the years to come.</p>

                <p>JWST has also observed the transit of an exoplanet across its star. This transit allows astronomers to measure the size 
                    and mass of the exoplanet, and it can also be used to study the atmosphere of the exoplanet.</p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>The James Webb Space Telescope is still in its early stages of operation, but it has already made a number of 
                groundbreaking discoveries. JWST is changing our understanding of the early universe, star formation, and exoplanets. 
                In the years to come, JWST is expected to make many more discoveries that will revolutionize our understanding of the universe.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Additional thoughts</h3>
                <p>JWST is also helping us to learn more about our own Milky Way galaxy. For example, JWST has detected a previously 
                unknown star-forming region in the Milky Way, and it has also observed the galactic center in unprecedented detail.</p>
                <p>JWST is also being used to study asteroids, comets, and other small bodies in our solar system. JWST can detect 
                the faint infrared light emitted by these objects, and it can also analyze their surfaces for signs of water, ice, 
                and other molecules.</p>
                <p>The James Webb Space Telescope is a truly revolutionary telescope, and it is already having a major impact on our 
                understanding of the universe. As JWST continues to collect data, we can expect to learn even more about the cosmos.</p>
